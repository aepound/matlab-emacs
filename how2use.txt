This repository is a cvsimport of the CVS repository of the 
official sourceforge matlab-emacs project. 
My goal in creating this was to be able to easily update to 
the newest official version of matlab-emacs.  
The idea of using git appealed to me, as I'm not very 
familiar with CVS. Plus it also lets me use this repo as 
a submodule in another repo I have.

The steps to get this working are fairly simple.
0. Install git (obviously) and git-cvs.

1. Clone the repo with the mirroring capabilities of git:
> git clone --mirror original-repo.git path/to/repo/.git
> cd path/to/repo
> git config --bool core.bare false
> git checkout cvsimport

2. Run the command ./setup_cvsimport

3. Go back to the master branch.

4. Run CVSimport
> git cvsimport

**** Important ****
If you have decided to hack on matlab-emacs, I highly suggest that 
you do so in another branch, leaving master as a pristine copy of 
the CVS repo.  If you'd like to contribute back upstream, you'll 
want to look into git cvsexportcommit.

Good luck.
Any questions, let me know.
Thanks,
